# About Me

Hello! I'm **Sung-Min Park** (박성민).

## Background

<!-- I'm currently pursuing an integrated MS-PhD program in Physics at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). -->

I'm currently on academic leave for military service as a Military Science and Technology Soldier.

<!-- 
My research interests lie at the fascinating intersection of **physics** and **machine learning**, where I explore how computational methods can unlock new insights into complex quantum systems. 

## Research Interests

**Physics**
- **Tensor Networks**: Efficient representations of quantum many-body states
- **Neural Network States**: Machine learning approaches to quantum many-body problems  
- **Quantum Computing & Quantum Information**: Computational aspects of quantum systems

**Machine Learning**
- **Physics-Informed Deep Learning**: Applying ML techniques to solve physics problems
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Quantum algorithms for machine learning tasks
- **Computational Methods**: Developing efficient algorithms for complex systems

## Personal Interests

Beyond research, I enjoy **coding** and **traveling**. There's something particularly satisfying about implementing complex physical phenomena in code and creating visualizations that make abstract concepts tangible.

I find great joy in:
- Building computational tools for physics research
- Exploring new places and cultures
- Learning about emerging technologies at the intersection of science and engineering

## Philosophy

I believe that the most exciting discoveries happen at the boundaries between disciplines. By combining the rigor of physics with the power of modern computational tools, we can tackle problems that were previously intractable and gain new perspectives on fundamental questions about nature.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, collaboration ideas, or just want to chat about physics, machine learning, or anything in between!
