## Overview

**emergence-theme** is an open-source Jekyll portfolio theme extracted from this site. It provides a complete starting point for researchers and academics who want a minimal, visually refined portfolio without building from scratch.

## Features

- Dual dark/light themes with CSS custom properties — toggled at runtime
- Content collections for Projects, Notes, and Readings with tag filtering and sort controls
- Bento grid homepage
- Post layout with TOC sidebar, breadcrumb navigation, and Utterances comments
- 2,800+ line SCSS design system — fully tokenized, customizable via `_data/` YAML
- No theme gem dependency — pure Jekyll 4.3

## Design Concepts

- **Dark mode** — Stellar Blue: deep-space indigo-black with cyan accent
- **Light mode** — Deep Glacier: ice-tinted white with saturated navy accent
- Glass morphism cards with backdrop blur
- Ultra-light typography (100–300 weight) for minimal visual noise
